/*
reducer is defined here and is exproted.
This reducer should handle all the actions.
Example of how to use reducer is as follows:
const reducer = (state = [],action = {}) => {
  switch(action.type){
    case 'actionType1': 
      return changedState1;
    
    case 'actionType2':
      return changedState2;
    default: 
      return state;
    }
  
export default reducer;
*/
import { combineReducers } from "redux";
import { SIGN_IN, SIGN_OUT } from "./actions";

const initalState = {
  loggedIn: false,
  username: ''
};
const authReducer = (state = initalState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case SIGN_IN: return {
      loggedIn: true,
      username: action.payload
    };
    case SIGN_OUT: return {
      loggedIn: false,
      username: ''
    };
    default: return state
  }
}

const reducers = combineReducers({
  auth: authReducer
})

export default reducers;
